Hi there! My name is Zaid and I am currently a final year University student specializing in IT Security and aspiring to kickstart my professional journey as a Security Analyst. In addition to my academic pursuits, I have acquired certifcations including the [CompTIA Security+](https://www.credly.com/badges/da6fd11c-6351-4b3d-8988-5f23795f00d2/public_url) as well as the [Blue Team Level 1](https://www.credly.com/badges/0d0eeffa-fe88-4607-a468-44e8cfcf1b13/public_url) certification.

This blog serves as a repository for my personal projects and write-ups related to various Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, with a specific focus on blue teaming and defensive security. If you wish to connect, please feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zaidp/).
